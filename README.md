# Studio Victoria - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This project has the purpose to showcase Front End Development taking in consideration UI/UX design.

The company name, address and phone used on this website are not real and only for display purposes.
 
## UX
 
 I have built this website with a minimalistic aproach keeping a clean look and a intuitive navigation bar on the top and a footer through all the pages.
 I choose for a black and white approach to create the clean contrast without taking the professional look of the business. 
 
 #### Wireframe
 I created a Wireframe as initial idea and the project grew as it was being developed and Mentoring meetings. The Original wireframe created with Balsamiq Wireframe 4 can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DUWDDtpCG4NfTBl6LneKAYksz2wpe8sr?usp=sharing
 
## Features

- This website was created with a Mobile first approach to a Full HD Desktop screen.
- The Hero image has a Zoom effect to get the viewer attention.
- Cookies message with closing button.
- Footer Company address lead link to Google Maps.
- Footer Phone lead link to phone call app.
- Caroussel gallery showcase.

## Testing

I tested the website during all stages of development keeping in mind that I used Google Chrome as main. I also sent the link to my friends and family to test during this process as I don't have Apple products myself to test.

Testing responsiviness of the website on Desktop and Mobile:

### index.html:
- Google Chrome: Everything working as expected on Desktop and Mobile.
- Microsoft Edge: Everything working as expected on Desktop and Mobile.
- FireFox: All features working as expected, but website seems to render in a bigger resolution not filling all the page on Desktop.
- Internet Explorer: All features working as expected, but website seems to render in a bigger resolution not filling all the page on Desktop - Social links in the footer not centralized when testing in a mobile view.

### about.html
- Google Chrome: Everything working as expected on Desktop and Mobile.
- Microsoft Edge: Everything working as expected on Desktop and Mobile.
- FireFox: All features working as expected, but website seems to render in a bigger resolution not filling all the page on Desktop.
- Internet Explorer: Seems like the CSS or Bootstrap is not being rendered properly causing the Cards to be very big, it is ugly but doesn't affect the usability of the page on Desktop view - Social links in the footer not centralized when testing in a mobile view.

### gallery.html:

- Internet Explorer: All features working as expected, but website seems to render in a bigger resolution not filling all the page on Desktop - Social links in the footer not centralized when testing in a mobile view.

#### Form testing:

I tested the form on Mobile and Desktop:
- The mailto attibute does not work on Android Mobile, but works on iPhone.
- Tested field verificarion in all 4 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE) confirming that on Desktop everything is working as expected, only when all fields are filled correctly the mail application will be triggered with the information brought from the form.
- On Safari for iPhone the form validation warnings are not aligned into the bubble.

#### Footer link testing:

I have tested the links using Mobile and Desktop:
- On Mobile it opens the correct app (Phone - Google Maps)
- Chrome on Desktop everything works correctly (Google Maps open in a new page - Phone ask if you want to call from your own phone )
- Firefox - Edge and IE opens Google Maps but ask you to link an app to complete the action.

### Known Bugs
- On Android the form is not opening the email app.
- Om iPhone the form validation messages, the text is not centralized into the bubble messages.
- On Internet explorer the cards on About section Bootstrap cards are not rezizing properly.
- The navigation menu when on mobile view, clicking on the Hamburguer menu seems to be jumpy to open the options.
